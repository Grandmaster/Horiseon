# Horiseon

## A site for a social services company

The Horiseon company asked for their website to be made more accessible, in order for their site to gain priority with search engines. I modified their site by adding semantic HTML tags, cleaning up the CSS and making sure the site functioned as it was intended to. I did all of this in Visual Studio Code and published the modified site using Github. 

Hopefully I have done enough to improve the site for the company.
